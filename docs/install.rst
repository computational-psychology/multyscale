Installation
=============

Multyscale is a true Python package, but not (yet) published on PyPI.
This will be fixed in an upcoming update.
For now, multyscale can be retrieved primarily from the `GitHub repository`_ ::

   git clone git@github.com:computational-psychology/multyscale.git

After downloading the repository, it can be installed (from the main directory)
using pip::

   pip install multyscale

This will install the package in your local Python packages,
after which the cloned repository can be removed,
without removing the installed package.

To remove the installed package completely, using pip::
   pip uninstall multyscale
