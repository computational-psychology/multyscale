# Explanations

Models of brightness perception are numerous and varied.
One major differentiating factor, is whether a model includes
mechanisms to explicitly resolve brightness perception phenoma;
or whether a model attempts to more generally model early vision such,
that brightness perception phenomena emerge but are not explicitly modeled.

A (super)family of models of the latter kind that have been particularly successful,
are multiscale spatial filtering models, examplified in the -ODOG genus of models.
